### Stock PCA
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform principal component analysis (PCA) on stock data.

### Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

-NumPy
-Pandas
-scikit-learn
-matplotlib (for plotting)
You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

### Usage
To run the notebook, you will need to have a recent version of Jupyter installed. You can follow the instructions here to install Jupyter.

Once you have Jupyter installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the directory in your terminal. Then, run the following command to start the Jupyter notebook server:

jupyter notebook

This will open a new browser window with the Jupyter dashboard. From there, you can navigate to the stock_pca.ipynb file and open it to view and run the code.

### Description
The notebook begins by loading stock data for a set of stocks into a Pandas DataFrame. It then performs feature scaling on the data and applies PCA to identify the underlying factors that drive the stock returns. Finally, it plots the factor exposures or loadings of the stocks on the identified factors.

The notebook includes detailed explanations and inline comments to help you understand the steps involved in performing PCA on stock data.
